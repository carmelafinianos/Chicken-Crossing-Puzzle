# Chicken Crossing Puzzle
The Chicken Crossing Puzzle Solver is a Python-based project that aims to solve the classic puzzle of crossing a river with a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn. In this project, AI algorithms are utilized to find the optimal sequence of moves for the robot to safely transport all three items across the river, adhering to specific constraints.

Python is the primary programming language used for this project, and it leverages AI algorithms and data structures to perform path finding and decision making. The project consists of several key components, including puzzle representation, state space search, and solution visualization.

The puzzle involves a robot and three items: a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn. The robot can carry only one item at a time and needs to transport all three items from one side of the river to the other. However, there are constraints to consider: the fox cannot be left alone with the chicken, and the chicken cannot be left alone with the sack of corn.

To solve this puzzle, AI algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) can be employed. These algorithms traverse the state space, representing different configurations of the robot and items, while ensuring that the constraints are not violated. The search algorithm determines the optimal sequence of moves that allows the robot to safely transport all items across the river.

The project also includes a graphical representation to visualize the puzzle and its solution. Visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pygame or Tkinter can be employed to create an interactive and intuitive user interface that displays the current state of the puzzle and highlights the robot's moves.
